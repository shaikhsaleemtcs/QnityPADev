Sandbox Refresh Notice
Force.com Sandbox: UTQA (full copy – DuPont UtilitiesOrg)
Start Refresh Copy: After ~5:00 PM ET Friday October 19, 2012

Activating a refreshed sandbox replaces the existing sandbox with the refreshed version. This permanently deletes the existing version and all data.
The Sandbox may be unavailable for use during the refresh period.
A notice will be forwarded when the refresh copy is activated.

What you need to do:
Please work with SFDC Admin Support to insure any configuration or customizations in progress have been saved, or backed up in another Org before the refresh begins.
